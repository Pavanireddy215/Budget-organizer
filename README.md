# Budget-Organizer
This is a budget organizing website to organize monthly budget effectively.

This is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript(Front End), Django 3.2.8(Back End) and MySQL(Database).

I must thank everyone who boosted me to finish this work successfully!

The Budget Organizer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* In the website, the details of income and expense have to be entered by the user.
* Then, the bar chart can be viewed to know the saving trend of the user of each month over a year.
* The user is notified 2 days before the expense date.

* Set up a virtual environment and install Django 3.2.8 or recent versions [refer Documentation site](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* Get MySQL and create a database [refer here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
