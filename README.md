# Budget-Organizer
This is a budget organizing website to organize monthly budget effectively.

This is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript(Front End), Django 4.0.2(Back End) and MySQL(Database).

I must thank everyone who boosted me to finish this work successfully!

The Budget Organizer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* In the website, the details of income and expense have to be entered by the user.
* Then, the bar chart can be viewed to know the saving trend of the user of each month over a year.
* The user is notified 2 days before the expense date.

To get this work in your system:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Get Python 3.10.2 or recent versions [refer here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Have a code editor [Visual Studio code or Pycharm or any..]
* Set up a virtual environment and install Django 4.0.2 or recent versions [refer Documentation site](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* Get MySQL and create a database [refer here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
* Get the code and connect the database to your django project
* Here you go! Type the command in the terminal to run the server in your browser
```
python manage.py runserver
```
